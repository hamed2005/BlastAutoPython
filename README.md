# BlastAutoPython

## Introduction

For gaining more insight into found spacers by Pilercr program, we aim to automate the Blast procedure and then blast all of the found spacers against NCBI nucleotide database.
First we start by extracting all spacers of a genome from Pilercr output.

## 0. Parsing pilercr outputs and extract all spacers and make a multi-fasta file with spacers in each line.

## 0+. small script (uniq-all-spacers.py) added for making all-spacers.fasta, unique. 

## 1. Automating the Blast procedure using BioPython package
