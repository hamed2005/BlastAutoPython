# BlastAutoPython

## Introduction

For gaining more insight into found spacers by Pilercr program, we aim to automate the Blast procedure and then blast all of the found spacers against NCBI nucleotide database.
First we start by extracting all spacers of a genome from Pilercr output.

## 0 Cleaning up the pilercr output and ectract all spacers in a genome and make a multi-fasta file with spacers in each line.

## 1 Automating the Blast procedure using BioPython package

(... In progress ...)
